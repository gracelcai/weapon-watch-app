Weapon Watch is an AI-powered, real-time weapon detection and emergency alert system, designed to protect K–12 schools from active shooter threats. Our system uses school-installed IP security cameras combined with advanced AI models to detect firearms. When a threat is identified, the system sends alerts directly to school administrators and law enforcement through an easy-to-use mobile app. The app also provides real-time location tracking of suspects through camera integration and a school floor plan/map. In its most advanced form, Weapon Watch can integrate a non-voice audio recognition module that detects gunshots, identifies the weapon type and caliber, and triangulates the shooter’s position without using facial or voice recognition.

Our solution is designed for maximum safety and minimal disruption. It is discreet – unlike traditional metal detectors or access control; It’s scalable – easy to install on a large number of school cameras; And, it’s privacy-focused – our AI does not store faces or voices, and we use a synthetic proprietary dataset to avoid copyright violations and bias. In addition to our technology, the Weapon Watch team provides extensive post-installation services including in-person setup, remote support, ongoing software updates, and manual threat verification. The long-term vision of Weapon Watch is to create a standardized emergency detection and response platform deployable not just in schools, but in universities, malls, stadiums, and public transportation hubs. However, our initial focus remains on K–12 school districts with high risk and active funding.

This Github repository contains the main source code of our mobile app.
